 ## Admin

To access the admin side of the application point a web browser to: ```	http://127.0.0.1:3001/admin```

 ## General Top Right
 There are no settings for engaing with the top right element at the present time. Technically the top-right 'controller' also looks after the score and progressbar at the bottom of the screen. 

 ## Fixtures
 By default this area just displays all the fixtures on a loop, split by sports. 
 By down-selecting any of the options the user can dictate what is shown within the fixtures area. 
 Once settings have been set, click 'Show Selected' to fire activate them.
